# Heterogeneous_Agent_Macro_Model
Computational method for solving heterogeneous agents macro models where the distribution is a state variable. The key challenge is that the aggregate state vector contains the distribution of agents which is infinite-dimensional. 
To deal with it, we can approximate the distribution with a parametric family and solve the endogenous parameters by perturbation.

# Heterogeneous-Agent-Macro-Model
Computational Method for solving heterogeneous agents macro models. The key challenge is that the aggregate state vector contains the distribution of agents which is infinite-dimensional. 
To deal with it, we can approximate the distribution with a parametric family and solve the endogenous parameters by perturbation.
